                <p> "Soup is a great group of people who wanted to explore what it meant to be an adult and still have fun which shaped my experience at Cornell. It is essentially a bunch of friends doing stuff all together and having experiences that are outside the box."</p><p>

                <p> "My general experience in outdoor events has been incredibly rewarding. I've had the opportunity to explore beautiful natural landscapes, challenge myself physically, and forge meaningful connections with other members of SOUP!"</p><p>-Sherki ,Cornell Freshman</p>
                <p> "I constantly have fun! It is exciting and entertaining. SOUP  gave me the chance to hang out with my friends and meet new people. I miss having this team experience."</p><P>-Tessa ,Cornell Alumnus </p>
                <p> "I've had a really great time being involved in the organization. It's a good mix of structured and unstructured fun. I don't feel like there's anyone being the 'parent' or saying no to doing things, within reason. It's a pick-your-own-adventure type of thing."</P><P>-Sofia ,Cornell Junior  </p>
