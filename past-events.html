      <h3>1. SNOWBALL FIGHT</h3>

      <p>
        Cornell rarely opts for a snow day, but when it does, you can be sure that SOUP will take full advantage of that.  Even when there's no snow day, sometimes SOUP hosts snowball fights with the snow from outside of Lynah rink!  This snow is there all year round, so sometimes SOUP even hosts snowball fights in the middle of August!

      <h3>2. CAMPING</h3>
      <p> One of the most common events that SOUP hosts is camping trips.  Many members of SOUP crave the outdoors constantly, so it is common for impromptu camping trips to happen on a weekend with little planning.  Some of the benefits of joining a camping trip hosted by SOUP is that you can count on gourmet food, a big bonfire, any camping gear might need, and a perfect camping spot complete with beautiful views.  In addition, SOUP always has a designated "EMT" (not certified as an EMT, but they are trained in wilderness medicine) to accompany every trip and event.

      <h3>3. LEAF PILE</h3>

      <p>
        The Big Leaf Pile is an annual event that has been put on by SOUP since the fall of 2021.  Each year on some sunny weekend day in October, a group of SOUP members get together in Danby State Forest (about a 20 minute car ride from Cornell), bearing their largest rakes and their most tick-proof clothing.  They then commence building a huge leaf pile and spend the rest of the day jumping into is from as high a height as possible.

      <h3>4. FIRE</h3>
      <p>
        Will it burn?  That was the central question of Burn Night.  Some people brought old class notes to burn for catharsis, some brought broken furniture to burn because it's cheaper than going to the dump, some brought rocks because they clearly didn't know how burning works.  The crowning achievement of the night was dropping a can of wax into the fire and watching it explode into a fireball.  Don't worry though; no people, animals, or plants were harmed in the making of Burn Night.

      <h3>5. CAPTURE THE FLAG</h3>
      <p>
        SOUP's 24-hour game of Capture the Flag has taken place every Labor Day weekend since 2021.  This game takes place in the Sugar Hill State Forest, about an hour away from Ithaca.  Some call it crazy, but those who've chosen to participate understand the magic that is 24-hour Capture the Flag.  Each game holds new surprises, unexpected challenges, deep connections, and too much fun to handle!

  <h2>POEMS</h2>
  <div class='poems'>
    <section>
      <h3>POEM 1</h3>
      <p> T’was the compelling cocoon of fall that did coax us in,
        Warm glow of orange crunches, red crackles, and yellow pops.
        Enamored with Earth, two hours we toiled for our mission,
        Mere fractions of the trees’ bounty we amassed without stops.
        ‘Til taller than us--and many times wide!--we did attain
        A crunchy cairn worthy of our foliage fane.</p>


        <p>‘Round the shrine of our labors we gathered to admire
        Until in our souls we felt the worship it did evoke.
        From the East we raced to jump in, blurry legs afire,
        From the West we dove, inserting between layers of oak.
        Even scaled branches above to courageously leap,
        Paying childhood joy as tribute to the mighty heap.</p>


        <p>In the peaceful wake of our joy, to the mound we succumbed.
        Into our warm autumnal nest we tucked, burrowing deep.
        We held hands in the center whilst together we chummed,
        “This definitely isn’t cult energy” you could hear us peep.
        It was here we laid, swaddled in nature’s safe shroud,
        ‘Til one by one, our phones with Cornell Alerts did buzz aloud.</p>

    <section><h3>POEM 2</h3>

  <p>Part I - Capture the Flag.
    You might have played capture the flag before, a common activity at school
    And this game was nothing out of the ordinary, except for just one rule
    This game lasted not the usual hour or two
    But from when the sun rose to when the sun arose anew
    No stops, no halts, no breaks
    A full 24 hours of sprinting, stalking, and high stakes</p>


  <p>Part II - Misty Dawn.
    The fourth of September, early morning
    Sunny skies but clouds in background forming
    Thirty three adventurers, a misty dawn on Sugar Hill
    Ignorant of the impending tests of will
    At first some friendly mingling
    But that is before the great partitioning
    Once separated into red and blue
    Their allegiance is not to friendship but to hue
    Separate ways each team goes
    A narrow gorge forming the boundary between foes
    Away from a world of stress, school, spitter, spatter
    Down into a world were flags are all that matter
    Red camp high on a ridge where the wind blows
    Blue camp in a valley under the shadows
    Without hesitation began the formation of strategy
    Of the best encroach on the enemy
    Then! the clock strikes mid-day
    The game finally gets underway </p>


  <p> Part III - Stalemate.
    Sprinting, scaling, tripping, falling
    determination meant no option of stalling
    Those who attack, close to the ground as they stalk
    Those who defend, eye on the woods like a hawk
    Stealthy offensive advances
    vigilant defensive stances
    But with flags remaining safely within their place
    No team could edge out the other in this epic race
    Hours of stealthy stalking went by
    As the sun descended from the sky</p>


  <p> Part IV - Nightfall.
    But whoever thought nightfall would keep each team on their respective side
    Had their suspicion quickly denied
    Faith in sight dismantled by a new moon
    Was replaced with the touch of feet on leaf, twig, and legume
    On both sides people leapt into the forest, into the deep
    The call of flag stronger than of sleep
    For the guards, noises entering one ear
    But no idea the enemy is near
    For the enemy, heart dropping in fright
    Every time the guard points into the forest with their light
    Suddenly. Contact! A guard's light hits an enemy's skin
    Commencing a dangerous chase to begin
    Throughout the night, between mouse's whisper and owl's hoot
    This repeating cycle of hide, search, and pursuit </p>


  <p> Part V - The Final Stalk.
    But, at thirty past three, in blue lands of West
    Occurred the move that would decide the rest
    A band of reds, into the blue valley they descend
    Little did anyone know, the beginning of the end
    On the cold forest bedrock
    They crawl their stealthiest stalk
    The blue camp's smoldering fire the only thing in their sight
    As the rest is shrouded by night
    Traveling tangent to the blue team's campsite
    They miraculously escape the enemy's light</p>


  <p>Part VI - Victory.
    Hours through the dark woods they patrol
    And now they finally reach their ultimate goal
    The flag! In the center of enemy land
    What was once a figment of dreams was now resting in their hand
    Half past four, red camp, only illuminated by an occasional spark
    Four heroes appear from the depths of dark
    Holding up high their newly captured treasure
    To some just a cloth, but to them a value impossible to measure
    As the sun crawled over the horizon and returned its shine
    The game was decided after twenty four hours of time </p>


  <p> Part VII - Memories.
    From the outside, capture the flag might seem kind of lame
    But in the moment, it was much more than just a game
    Through darkness, and cold, and rain
    everyone kept their full determination without restrain
    Maddie and I have been planning adventures together for quite some time
    But this one will forever be a favorite of mine
    The thirty three adventurers who had set out one full earth's rotation before
    Now have an experience they can forever adore
    All those glowing faces, even if they were scratched and covered with sweat
    They are something that I will never forget
    To all those adventurers who participated in this struggle of hue
    All I want to say, is thank you </p>
