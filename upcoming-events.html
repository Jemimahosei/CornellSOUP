                    <p> At SOUP, we play the classic game of manhunt a little differently.  In our version (adapted from a Dutch game called Hunting Season), one persone hides somewhere on Cornell's campus and their location is sent to the rest of the players every ten minutes.  The first player to find the person wins.  We take this game all over campus, and the only rules are that the person who's trying not to be caught is not allowed to go into anywhere with limited keycard access.  Other than that, anything goes! . </p>
