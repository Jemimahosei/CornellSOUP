Welcome blurb:

Hi there!  We are SOUP (Students for Oudoor Unsupervized Playtime).  Our organization was founded with the goal of connecting students who love to play around outside.  Founded in 2020 in the midst of the pandemic by four sophomore roommates, SOUP now boasts over 500 members.  Unlike other outdoor activity-centered clubs at Cornell, SOUP is not an official university-registered club, so a lot of SOUP activities are a bit more extreme than the activities organized by other clubs.  If you love nature, spontaneity, meeting new people, staying up all night, and doing things that Cornell would rather not know about, then welcome to the club!

History of the org:

SOUP was founded in 2020 by four bored, covid-constrained sophomore roommates who shared a love of adventure, a need for nature, and a fondness for a little bit of organized chaos.  In one all-nighter, SOUP went from a vague idea to an actual organization with social media accounts, a leadership team, a logo, and a mission.  Just a few months after its founding, SOUP was hosting their first ever annual game of 24-hour capture the flag.  Ever since then, SOUP has had a dedicated following.  SOUP puts on 10+ events every year, each time with a robust turnout.  Through its four years of existence, SOUP has created friendships, romances, rivalries, and a whole lot of fun.

Past events: leaf pile:

The Big Leaf Pile is an annual event that has been put on by SOUP since the fall of 2021.  Each year on some sunny weekend day in October, a group of SOUP members get together in Danby State Forest (about a 20 minute car ride from Cornell), bearing their largest rakes and their most tick-proof clothing.  They then commence building a huge leaf pile and spend the rest of the day jumping into is from as high a height as possible.

Past events: burn night:

Will it burn?  That was the central question of Burn Night.  Some people brought old class notes to burn for catharsis, some brought broken furniture to burn because it's cheaper than going to the dump, some brought rocks because they clearly didn't know how burning works.  The crowning achievement of the night was dropping a can of wax into the fire and watching it explode into a fireball.  Don't worry though; no people, animals, or plants were harmed in the making of Burn Night.

Past events: camping:

One of the most common events that SOUP hosts is camping trips.  Many members of SOUP crave the outdoors constantly, so it is common for impromptu camping trips to happen on a weekend with little planning.  Some of the benefits of joining a camping trip hosted by SOUP is that you can count on gourmet food, a big bonfire, any camping gear might need, and a perfect camping spot complete with beautiful views.  In addition, SOUP always has a designated "EMT" (not certified as an EMT, but they are trained in wilderness medicine) to accompany every trip and event.
