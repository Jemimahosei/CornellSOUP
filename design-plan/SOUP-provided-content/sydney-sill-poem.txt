T’was the compelling cocoon of fall that did coax us in,
Warm glow of orange crunches, red crackles, and yellow pops.
Enamored with Earth, two hours we toiled for our mission,
Mere fractions of the trees’ bounty we amassed without stops.
‘Til taller than us--and many times wide!--we did attain
A crunchy cairn worthy of our foliage fane.


‘Round the shrine of our labors we gathered to admire
Until in our souls we felt the worship it did evoke.
From the East we raced to jump in, blurry legs afire,
From the West we dove, inserting between layers of oak.
Even scaled branches above to courageously leap,
Paying childhood joy as tribute to the mighty heap.


In the peaceful wake of our joy, to the mound we succumbed.
Into our warm autumnal nest we tucked, burrowing deep.
We held hands in the center whilst together we chummed,
“This definitely isn’t cult energy” you could hear us peep.
It was here we laid, swaddled in nature’s safe shroud,
‘Til one by one, our phones with Cornell Alerts did buzz aloud.
