# Team Contract

Working together as a team is critical for your success on this project. Conflicts are normal and to be expected. It's best to develop a plan for handling conflicts before they arise.

**This contract is a _living_ document.** If it's not working, your team should revise it as often as necessary.

## Contract

Your team contract should probably include these elements. Feel free to remove or add other terms, too.

1. We will text each other before making any new Git commits in order to help with collaboration and prevent merge conflicts.
2. We will collaborate to finish each milestone at least 2 hours before the deadline.
3. Robyn will do the submission form every time.
4. We will review each otherâ€™s work before submitting each milestone.
5. We will meet to evenly distribute work for each milestone before starting to work on it.
6. We will use our group chat as a primary means of communication and schedule zoom/in person meetings as necessary.
7. We will notify each other as soon as possible if a conflict for our meeting time comes up or if one of us feels that they are unable to do their work on time.
8. We will meet with our client before spring break ends.
9. We will all put forth our best effort and ask for help when needed/wanted.


## Using your Contract

You are expected to follow your team contract. **If you are having issues (e.g. conflicts) in your team, the first thing you should do is follow the contract.** If the contract isn't working, then your team should revise it.

If you cannot resolve your conflict using the contract, please email the instructors at <info1300@cornell.edu>. Please be advised, that the first thing the instructor will ask you is, "did you try to resolve your issue with the contract?" The next question the instructor will ask you is, "what change did you make to your contract to resolve the issue?" You must attempt to resolve your conflicts on your own first before an instructor will intervene.
