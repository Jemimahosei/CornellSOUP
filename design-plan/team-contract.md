# Team Contract

Working together as a team is critical for your success on this project. Conflicts are normal and to be expected. It's best to develop a plan for handling conflicts before they arise.

**This contract is a _living_ document.** If it's not working, your team should revise it as often as necessary.

## Contract

Your team contract should probably include these elements. Feel free to remove or add other terms, too.

1. We will text each other before making any new Git commits in order to help with collaboration and prevent merge conflicts.
2. We will collaborate to finish each milestone at least 2 hours before the deadline.
3. Robyn will do the submission form every time.
4. We will review each other’s work before submitting each milestone.
5. We will meet to evenly distribute work for each milestone before starting to work on it.
6. We will use our group chat as a primary means of communication and schedule zoom/in person meetings as necessary.
7. We will notify each other as soon as possible if a conflict for our meeting time comes up or if one of us feels that they are unable to do their work on time.
8. We will meet with our client before spring break ends.
9. We will all put forth our best effort and ask for help when needed/wanted.

<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
    We commit to splitting up work evenely, communicating with the group on our individual progress, submitting milestones on time. In terms of the team atmosphere, we commit to the goal of avoiding group tension by treating eachother with respect and kindness.


2. What are our "ground rules"? (Don't make an exhaustive list—stick with just a few.)

- Listen to eachother and consider all opinions in the group
- Split up work evenly
- Communicate with the group via text group chat
- Review eachother's work before submitting each milestone


1. By what means and how frequently will we meet or communicate?

    We will principally communicate via text and will meet (over zoom or in person) when needed. We will likely meet once per milestone to plan and divide work and will text daily with updates on our progress.


2. How will we communicate and work with our client?

    We will principally communicate with our client via email/meetings. Meetings will be in zoom or in person (whatever is most convenient fir the client).


3. What roles will we create? Include a description of exactly what each role is responsible for. (**No "coder" or "designer" roles are permitted;** everyone must design and code.)

    **Tip:** It's often helpful to think of **responsibilities** rather than roles here.

    Isabel will be the prime communicator with the client. Robyn will handle all submission forms once final commits are made so that the submission form is never forgotten. Beyond this, each member will contribute equally to the completion of the project.


4. How will we hold ourselves and one another accountable? What (exactly) will we say to a team member who appears not to be contributing equally? To a team member who fails to deliver what was promised?

    We agree to each hold ourselves accountable and do our best to complete our fair share of the project. When we fall behind or have any difficulties completing our delegated work, we will communicate that to the group and come up with a plan (that everyone agrees with) to solve the issue. When holding eachother accountable, we promise to, above all, treat eachother with understanding and respect. While true, if there is a team member who appears to not be contributing equally or someone who fails to deliver what was promised, we agree that it is reasonable for another member of the team to remind this member of their responsibilities to the group and express any frustrations the group has.


7. What do we do when we disagree? What approach to conflict to we all agree to uphold?

    We agree to air our disagreements, but doing so in a manner that is respectful to group members and productive for the completion of the project. We see disagreements as an opportunity to ensure our work is as good as it can be and also to strengthen our skills as collaborators, as long as we disagree politely and reasonably.


8. What are our procedures for re-visiting this contract?

    When any group member encounters an issue within the group, they will suggest a meeting to discuss revising the contract as they see fit. We will make sure the group is a safe, welcoming environment in which each group member feels comfortable speaking up when something is not working for them.


9. What else do we want to include in this contract? Maybe you team needs a _fun_ clause...

    **Tip:** Not everything in life is about work. Sometimes it is important to celebrate too. Consider grabbing a coffee or ice cream at the completion of your project to celebrate!

    We will start and end our meetins catching up casually with eachother, discussing our days and other things going on in our lives. We hope to end this project with a successful website, but also new friendships with eachother as people with shared interests!

10. We will finish and complete the submission form for each milestone 2 hours before the deadline.

## Using your Contract

You are expected to follow your team contract. **If you are having issues (e.g. conflicts) in your team, the first thing you should do is follow the contract.** If the contract isn't working, then your team should revise it.

If you cannot resolve your conflict using the contract, please email the instructors at <info1300@cornell.edu>. Please be advised, that the first thing the instructor will ask you is, "did you try to resolve your issue with the contract?" The next question the instructor will ask you is, "what change did you make to your contract to resolve the issue?" You must attempt to resolve your conflicts on your own first before an instructor will intervene.
