### Poem #1
T’was the compelling cocoon of fall that did coax us in,
Warm glow of orange crunches, red crackles, and yellow pops.
Enamored with Earth, two hours we toiled for our mission,
Mere fractions of the trees’ bounty we amassed without stops.
‘Til taller than us--and many times wide!--we did attain
A crunchy cairn worthy of our foliage fane.


‘Round the shrine of our labors we gathered to admire
Until in our souls we felt the worship it did evoke.
From the East we raced to jump in, blurry legs afire,
From the West we dove, inserting between layers of oak.
Even scaled branches above to courageously leap,
Paying childhood joy as tribute to the mighty heap.


In the peaceful wake of our joy, to the mound we succumbed.
Into our warm autumnal nest we tucked, burrowing deep.
We held hands in the center whilst together we chummed,
“This definitely isn’t cult energy” you could hear us peep.
It was here we laid, swaddled in nature’s safe shroud,
‘Til one by one, our phones with Cornell Alerts did buzz aloud.

### Poem #2
Part I - Capture the Flag
You might have played capture the flag before, a common activity at school
And this game was nothing out of the ordinary, except for just one rule
This game lasted not the usual hour or two
But from when the sun rose to when the sun arose anew
No stops, no halts, no breaks
A full 24 hours of sprinting, stalking, and high stakes


Part II - Misty Dawn
The fourth of September, early morning
Sunny skies but clouds in background forming
Thirty three adventurers, a misty dawn on Sugar Hill
Ignorant of the impending tests of will
At first some friendly mingling
But that is before the great partitioning
Once separated into red and blue
Their allegiance is not to friendship but to hue
Separate ways each team goes
A narrow gorge forming the boundary between foes
Away from a world of stress, school, spitter, spatter
Down into a world were flags are all that matter
Red camp high on a ridge where the wind blows
Blue camp in a valley under the shadows
Without hesitation began the formation of strategy
Of the best encroach on the enemy
Then! the clock strikes mid-day
The game finally gets underway


Part III - Stalemate
Sprinting, scaling, tripping, falling
determination meant no option of stalling
Those who attack, close to the ground as they stalk
Those who defend, eye on the woods like a hawk
Stealthy offensive advances
vigilant defensive stances
But with flags remaining safely within their place
No team could edge out the other in this epic race
Hours of stealthy stalking went by
As the sun descended from the sky


Part IV - Nightfall
But whoever thought nightfall would keep each team on their respective side
Had their suspicion quickly denied
Faith in sight dismantled by a new moon
Was replaced with the touch of feet on leaf, twig, and legume
On both sides people leapt into the forest, into the deep
The call of flag stronger than of sleep
For the guards, noises entering one ear
But no idea the enemy is near
For the enemy, heart dropping in fright
Every time the guard points into the forest with their light
Suddenly. Contact! A guard's light hits an enemy's skin
Commencing a dangerous chase to begin
Throughout the night, between mouse's whisper and owl's hoot
This repeating cycle of hide, search, and pursuit


Part V - The Final Stalk
But, at thirty past three, in blue lands of West
Occurred the move that would decide the rest
A band of reds, into the blue valley they descend
Little did anyone know, the beginning of the end
On the cold forest bedrock
They crawl their stealthiest stalk
The blue camp's smoldering fire the only thing in their sight
As the rest is shrouded by night
Traveling tangent to the blue team's campsite
They miraculously escape the enemy's light


Part VI - Victory
Hours through the dark woods they patrol
And now they finally reach their ultimate goal
The flag! In the center of enemy land
What was once a figment of dreams was now resting in their hand
Half past four, red camp, only illuminated by an occasional spark
Four heroes appear from the depths of dark
Holding up high their newly captured treasure
To some just a cloth, but to them a value impossible to measure
As the sun crawled over the horizon and returned its shine
The game was decided after twenty four hours of time


Part VII - Memories
From the outside, capture the flag might seem kind of lame
But in the moment, it was much more than just a game
Through darkness, and cold, and rain
everyone kept their full determination without restrain
Maddie and I have been planning adventures together for quite some time
But this one will forever be a favorite of mine
The thirty three adventurers who had set out one full earth's rotation before
Now have an experience they can forever adore
All those glowing faces, even if they were scratched and covered with sweat
They are something that I will never forget
To all those adventurers who participated in this struggle of hue
All I want to say, is thank you <3
