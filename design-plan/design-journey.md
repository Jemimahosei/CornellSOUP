# Group Project: Design Journey

**For each milestone, complete only the sections that are labeled with that milestone.** Refine all sections before the final submission.

You are graded on your design process. If you later need to update your plan, **do not delete the original plan, leave it in place and append your new plan _below_ the original.** Then explain why you are changing your plan. Any time you update your plan, you're documenting your design process!

**Replace ALL _TODOs_ with your work.** (There should be no TODOs in the final submission.)

Be clear and concise in your writing. Bullets points are encouraged.

Place all design journey images inside the "design-plan" folder and then link them in Markdown so that they are visible in Markdown Preview.

**Everything, including images, must be visible in _Markdown: Open Preview_.** If it's not visible in the Markdown preview, then we can't grade it. We also can't give you partial credit either. **Please make sure your design journey should is easy to read for the grader;** in Markdown preview the question _and_ answer should have a blank line between them.


## Client (Milestone 1)

### Client Description (Milestone 1)
> Tell us about your client. Who is your client?
> Explain why your client meets the client rules in the project requirements.

Our client is Cornell SOUP (students for outdoor unsupervised playtime), which is an unofficial campus club.  They are unofficial because they put on events that Cornell might not fully approve of in terms of safety (e.g. 24 hour capture the flag in the woods), though they do take safety very seriously and do their best to ensure the health of all SOUP activity participants.  For example, they have dedicated medics for each event and they ensure a means of communication with the outside world, even if the event takes place in a remote area.

SOUP was founded in 2021 during the pandemic.  It is currently being run by its second generation of leaders.  It is an organization dedicated to helping students connect with each other through "crazy" outdoor adventures.  They want to have a website that showcases their mission, the past events that they're put on, and their upcoming events.

SOUP leaders don't want a big site.  They just want something slightly more official and accessible than Intsagram and GroupMe to use to connect with their members and prospective participants.  They don't require a site reliant on advanced web design practices, so we are confident that we will be able to build a website that will be satisfactory.

### Client Questionnaire (Milestone 1)
> Develop a client questionnaire to learn more about your client and their goals.
> You may use the questionnaire below, you may modify the questionnaire below, or you may create your own.

1. Describe your organization and its purpose.


2. What makes your organization and its services special or unique?


3. Why are you looking for a new website or updating your existing site?


4. Who do you want to visit your site? Who do you believe is your website's intended audience?


5. What are your goals for this site?


6. Is there a "feel" that you want for your site? Are there colors or imagery that you have in mind?


7. (Modified due to the answer to question 4): What past experiences have led you to believe that a website would be a good addition to your organization?

8. Do you have any images and/or written content already that you'd like us to incorporate?


### First Client Meeting Minutes/Notes (Milestone 1)
> Include your notes/minutes from your first meeting with your client.

1. Please describe your organization and its purpose/mission.

- started SOUP because outing club, cornell outdoor education, etc. were lacking in more extreme adventures because they're officially linked to Cornell and liability is a limiting factor
- wanted to make a new organization for Cornell students that wasn't beholden to the same rules as other, more official organizations
- the goal of SOUP (Students for Outdoor Unsupervized Playtime) is to allow students who are a little bit crazy to do crazy things with other students who are a little bit crazy
- past events include 24-hour capture the flag and a campus-wide game of manhunt, among other things
- mission is to help connect students who want to participate in the crazier side of outdoor activities
- concerned about liability/not seeming to be too connected to Cornell
- started in 2020 because original founders wanted to play a 24-hour game of capture the flag, then SOUP was founded after that because it turned out to be so fun and people seemed to want more of that type of thing


2. What makes your organization and its services special or unique?

- 450+ members now
- all recruitment has been word of mouth
- not affiliated with Cornell officially, so not liable and constrained like other orgs are
- the entire organization has gained its following through word of mouth and no official recruitment events or outreach
- most events are held annually (for the last 4 years)
- values of the organization: playfulness, freedom, connection

1. Why are you looking for a new website or updating your existing site?

- currently there is no website
- lots of people have asked if there is a website
- currently, there's only an Instagram account (@cornell__soup)
- a website would be good for people who don't have instagram

4. Who do you want to visit your site? Who do you believe is your website's intended audience?

- want people who are interested in participating in SOUP events to visit the site
- also people who have participated in the past and might want to see photos of the past events
- intended audience: people who are interested in participating in a SOUP event and/or have already participated int one

5. What are your goals for this site?

- showcase previous events through photos and descriptions
- advertise upcoming events
- give some context and history around the existence of SOUP
- let newcommers learn about SOUP and what it has to offer
- help people pitch their own events for SOUP to put on

6. Is there a "feel" that you want for your site? Are there colors or imagery that you have in mind?

- logo is shades of orange and red, with notes of white and black
- definitely include the logo in the site
- lots of room for photos (maybe an image carousel)
- include the colors in the logo
- shouldn't be too crowded, want it to feel a bit loose and airy and playful
- should embody the values of the organization: playfulness, freedom, connection

7. (Modified due to the answer to question 4): What past experiences have led you to believe that a website would be a good addition to your organization?

- people have often asked before if SOUP has a website
- it would help people who don't have Instagram or GroupMe find out information about upcoming events
- central hub for all SOUP-related information
- would allow for more content than Instagram does (more text and photos)
- some people have heard about SOUP but then couldn't find anything online about it because there is no website and it's not an official Cornell club, so it's not listed on any Cornell site.  A website could help people who have just about it through word of mouth find it online when they search for it, if they weren't added to the GroupMe when they heard about it.

8. Do you have any images and/or written content already that you'd like us to incorporate?

Yes, they will share it with us later.

### Client Website (Milestone 1)
> Tell us about the website that your client wants.
> Tell us the purpose of the website and what it is all about.
> Note: **If you are redesigning an existing website, give us the current URL and some screenshots of the current site.** (FireFox makes it easy to take a full screenshot of a page from the context menu (right click).)
> If you are redesigning an existing site, tell us how you plan to update the site significantly that meets the project's requirements.

The leaders of SOUP want a website that showcases their past successful events.  They also want to provide information about upcoming events.  Also, they want to have a lot of photos on the website.  They want it to look somewhat professional without being too polished and clean.  They want it to have an outdoorsy, whimsical vibe.  It will replace the GroupMe QR code on all future signs/flyers, so people will be directed to the site.  People who scan these flyers are interested in the specific event that it's advertising, but they might not already know about SOUP, so imagine the website as a landing page for people who might not know what SOUP is but are interested in potentially participating.  Lastly, they want to have information on how to join SOUP leadership and/or pitch ideas for events.  There is no official leadership, it's really just whoever want to put on an event is able to, so they want to have a place on the website where you can pitch events.

### Client Goals (Milestone 1)
> Identify your client's goals for the website.
> What kind of website do they want? What are their goals for the site?
> There is no required number of goals. You need as many goals as necessary to reflect your client's desires.

- Goal #1: Showcase their previous events through images and text.
- Goal #2: Advertise upcoming events and provide details about them.
- Goal #3: Provide information about what SOUP is, its mission, and its backstory.
- Goal #4: Guide people on how to pitch their own SOUP events.

### Client Website Scope (Milestone 1)
> We want your project to be successful! It needs to be ambitious, but not too large.
> A good rule-of-thumb is that you should have about 1 content-full page for each team member.
> Explain why the website you will create for your client isn't too small and isn't too big.
> Explain why you think it's the right size for this project.

There are four main goals for the site, which is perfect because there are four of us in the group.  Besides having lots of photos, SOUP leadership doesn't want the site to be too big or cumbersome, and they said that ideally it would be 5 pags maximum.  They also don't want anything too fancy, which is good for us because we will certainly learn enough in this class to address their needs.  The people in charge of SOUP are other students, so it's easy to stay in touch with them and having meetings on campus.

## Plan/Schedule (Milestone 1)
> Make a plan of when you will complete all parts of this assignment.
> This plan is for your team. There is no required format. Format it so that it works for you!
> Your plan should include when you will interview users and analyze their goals.
> Your plan should also include how and when you will assemble/create the sit's content.
> **Tip:** Your team should plan to work ahead. This project really isn't feasible to complete the night before a deadline.

- skipped this question because she talked about her experience with SOUP earlier in the previous part of the interview

5. What haven't I asked you today that you think would be valuable for me to know?

- "I think a website would be really good for SOUP.  It would be really helpful to have a central place to go to see what vents are happening instead of just having to check the GroupMe all the time to find out that stuff."

### Goals (Milestone 2)
> Analyze your audience's goals from your notes above.
> List each goal below. There is no specific number of goals required for this, but you need enough to do the job (Hint: It's more than 1 and probably more than 2).

Goal 1: to gain knowledge about upcoming SOUP events and other related logistical information
- **Design Ideas and Choices** _How will you meet those goals in your design?_
  - We can meet this goal by including information on the page about upcoming SOUP events, including their time and location, as well as including links to join SOUP groupchats for further information and discussion of events. We can design the site so that this information is clear and available to users, perhaps by designating this information to clearly titled pages.
  -
- **Rationale & Additional Notes** _Justify your decisions; additional notes._
  - Including this event and logistical information and organizing it in a way that is readable and clear is key for meeting this goal. Audience interviewees expressed a struggle to find clear, consistent information about SOUP's events; these design choices can help solve this problem for the organization.
  - This goal particularly targets existing SOUP members seeking to continue their participation in the organization,

Goal 2: to enjoy time being active outside amongst like-minded people
- **Design Ideas and Choices** _How will you meet those goals in your design?_
  - We can meet this general goal of users to enjoy time being active outside and in the company of others by highlighting SOUP's emphasis on taking advantage of the beautiful outdoors in and around Cornell's campus to bond with others. We can, more specifically, include images from events in different outdoor locations. We can also include lots of images of people having fun in groups while at SOUP events. We can also include descriptive text, or even testimonials from SOUP members, about how SOUP facilitates outdoor activity and social interaction. We can also create a outdoors-inspired, foresty theme for the site, perhaps implementing a color scheme with lots of greens.
  -
  - About/Home page introducing the club, a page featuring past events, testimonials for people who participated from the past
- **Rationale & Additional Notes** _Justify your decisions; additional notes._
  - Including content illustrating SOUP's efforts to spend time outdoors and enjoy time with others will illustrate SOUP's emphasis on community-building and outdoor activity, so as to help audiences recognize how SOUP will help them reach their goal. Creating a theme that gives the site and outdoorsy vibe will also help target this audience goal.

Goal 3: to gain knowledge about SOUP organization's mission and past events to investigate SOUP as a potential outlet for outdoor fun
- **Design Ideas and Choices** _How will you meet those goals in your design?_
  - We can meet this goal by including general content on the site that introduces the organization and it's mission, particularly text content. This content could include a history of SOUP, information about past events hosted by SOUP, and quotes from people involved. We could maybe highlight this information by placing it on the home page so it is very accessible for the audience.

- **Rationale & Additional Notes** _Justify your decisions; additional notes._
  - Designing the site so that SOUP's goals as an organization are evident, specifically through the inclusion of thorough text content about SOUP's origins and recent activity, can certainly help meet this goal of users to investigate SOUP as a new method for enjoying the outdoors. Making this content very obvious and emphasized on the site on a main page will be key for this.


### Audience (Milestone 2)
> Briefly explain your site's audience.
> Be specific and justify why this audience is a **cohesive** group with regard to your website.

The audience for SOUP's website is, generally speaking, Cornell students who are interested in group outdoor activity. More specifically, the audience is both existing SOUP members and potential members who may want to explore this interest through SOUP. Although it encompasses two groups, this audience is cohesive in that all audience members are united by a common goal of spending time outdoors being active and enjoying the company of like-minded individuals.


## Website Design Exploration (Milestone 2)

Identify three websites (preferably static websites) that exist today on the web to draw inspiration from. Please select websites that are similar to the website you wish to create.

Include two screenshots of the home page for each site: narrow and wide.

**We'll refer to these are your "example websites."**

### Example Website 1 Review (Milestone 2)
> Review the website you identified above. (1 paragraph)
> In your review, include a discussion common design patterns and interactivity in the site.

Here is what the website does effectively regarding layout, interactivity, and responsiveness:

- When the site is narrow the nav menu becomes a hamburger menu and when the site is wide the nav menu is easy to find at the top of the page below the header.  Both of these are traditional, familiar design patterns.
- The image carousel at the top of the page adds a nice level of interactivity that allows users to scroll through the images in a familiar way.  The carousel is present in the narrow version of the site as well, but without the menu and extra text overlapping with it.
- The 3-column grid layout of links and photos in the wide layout becomes a 2-column grid in the medium layout, and then becomes a single column of content in the mobile site.  This is helpful because it allows the content to still take prominence in the narrow layout, even though the window width is smaller.
- The site has links to other pages in multiple places instead of just in the nav bar.  This is helpful because it allows users to see an image or read a short description of something and then choose to read more, only if they choose to click on it.  This would likely not be useful on the site we're building for SOUP because it seems more suitable for a large site with lots and lots of pages.

Here is what the site does poorly:

- In the narrow version, it is confusing to have two hamburger menus at the top of the screen.  One is present in both versions of the site and the other only appears in the narrow version.
- The faded overlay is not ideal for the hero images at the top of the page because it infringes too much on the images and undercuts their prominence and importance by blocking them out a bit.
- In the narrow version of the site, some of the images and videos are too wide and go off of the screen instead of adjusting their width/layout to fit on the screen.  This is mainly an issue with videos.
- Some of the images don't have alt text, and some have poorly written alt text.


### Example Website 2 Review (Milestone 2)
> Review the website you identified above. (1 paragraph)
> In your review, include a discussion common design patterns and interactivity in the site.

Here is what the website does effectively regarding layout, interactivity, and responsiveness:

- They have an interactive calendar feature where you can toggle between the weekly and monthly calendars.  This exists in both the narrow and wide versions of the site and it is very helpful to be able to se both versions of the calendar without going to different pages or having to scroll.
- The photos on their home page are in a single row for the wide layout and transition to two rows for the narrow layout.  This follows common design patterns and allows users to view the photos in the narrow layout without them becoming too small.
- Some of the photos bring users to the club's Instagram page when clicked on.  This could be useful for SOUP because they have a lot of photos that they would like on their site, many of which are already posted on Instagram.  Additionally, Instagram (in addition to GroupMe) has been the only form of social media/online presence that SOUP has had so far, so it might be helpful to users to provide the link to SOUP's Instagram on the website.
- The navigation menu collapses into a hamburger menu when the site is narrow.  This is a common design pattern and it is implemented well on this website.
- The video as well as photos resize appropriately according to the screen width.

Here is what the site does poorly:

- The header text is helpful and the header image is a powerful image, but the way that they are layered isn't visually appealing.  It would be better if the text was above or below the image so it didn't block out the image.  The way it is on the site detracts from both the header text and the header image.
- You can't directly click on the nav menu links to navigate to a new page.  Instead, a drop down menu appears for each link.  This goes against best web design practices.  It would be better to have a new "home page" for each category listed in the nav bar, each with its own nav bar for various pages under that category.  Users expect a nav bar to link to different pages, so it's annoying to click on a link in the nav bar and not be taken to a new page.
- The video quality isn't very good at all, though this might not be something that they have any control over if it's hosted on YouTube or some other service.
- At intermediate screen widths (between narrow and wide), the nav menu wraps around so one menu item is below the rest.  This looks sloppy and out of place, and it would be better if it seamlessly transitioned from the full-width nav menu to the hamburger menu instead of having a strange, visually unappealing mid-size layout.
- The footer is relatively large in the narrow version of the website.  The footer height makes sense in the wide version of the site, but it takes up a lot of space and the text elements contained within it have a disproportionate amount of padding/margin in the narrow version, making the footer bigger than it needs to be ideally folloing bst web design practices.

### Example Website 3 Review (Milestone 2)
> Review the website you identified above. (1 paragraph)
> In your review, include a discussion common design patterns and interactivity in the site.

Here is what the website does effectively regarding layout, interactivity, and responsiveness:

- It's helpful that the image carousel automatically changes pictures without the user having to manually select a new picture, even though they can still do that if they wish.  This allows users to passively see multiple images or navigate to one in particular, so it's a mix of passive and active interactivity.
- The site has is a very consistent theme throughout including topographical maps as a background for each image, the signature NOLS font being used for all header text, and the NOLS shade of orange making multiple appearances in various places.
- The Featured Expeditions section of the home page changes from a grid in the wide version of the site into a carousel in the narrow version of the site.  This is a common design pattern, so users are familiar with it and that helps with ease of use.  It's also an effective way to change the layout of the content so as to not crowd the page with content or make it too excessively prominent.
- In the narrow version of the site, there is just the NOLS logo along with a hamburger menu at the top of the page whereas in the wide version of the site layout, there is a full horizontal nav bar.  This is a common design pattern and it's very effective at reducing clutter in the narrow version of a website.
- In the narrow version, images are (for the most part) in a single column and they take up the full width of the page, allowing users to see them fully even though the screen is smaller.  In the wide version, images are mostly in two columns side by side.  This is a common web design pattern so users are familiar with it.

### Content Justification (Milestone 2)
> Explain (about a paragraph) why this content is the right content for your site's audience and how the content addresses their goals.

The target audience's goals regarding the site are to find out information about SOUP's mission, learn about past events, learn about upcoming events, and learn how to get involved.  We meet all of these needs with our planned content.  We have plenty of images to showcase past events, along with a description of some past events.  We also have information describing upcoming events.  We've included SOUP's history and a blurb describing what SOUP is/does.  Lastly, we also have information about how to get in touch with SOUP leadership and how to beconme a part of the organization.  These pieces of content together meet all of the users' goals.



## Information Architecture (Milestone 2)

### Content Organization (Milestone 2)
> Document your **iterations** of card sorting here. You must have at least 2 iterations of card sorting.
> Include photographic evidence of each iteration of card sorting **and** description of your thought process for each iteration.
> Please physically sort cards; please don't try and do this digitally.

Iteration 1:
![First iteration of card sorting for content organization](content-iteration1.png)

For iteration 1, we grouped content into four general categories: upcoming events, past events, how to get involved and get in touch, and general information about what SOUP is.  These categories match up with the user goals we stated above in the goals section.  We decided to separate past events and upcoming events because some users may want to learn about what SOUP has done in the past, while others might just be interested in what's coming up in the future.  We made one category with general information about SOUP, so users can learn more about SOUP's mission and history.  We separated the contact info/how to get involved info into its own category because some people who come to the site might just want to learn more about SOUP and its events and might decide not to join, and some might already be a part of SOUP so they don't need that information.

Iteration 2:
![Second iteration of card sorting for content organization](content-iteration2.png)

For iteration 2, we decided to highlight two of the largest annual SOUP events by grouping content related to them into their own categories.  These events are capture the flag and 161 things.  In addition to these categories, we sorted the rest of the content into a category for past events/other annual events, as well as a category with information about how to get involved and general information about SOUP (history and what it's all about).  This meets the audience's needs by highlighting two major upcoming events, which are a big reason that people might come to the site.  By putting these two events in their own categories, it allows users to easily find information that it is probable that they are looking for.  We combined the general information about SOUP with the information about how to get involved/get in touch because it makes sense to have all of this general information on the home page so users don't have to go digging around for information about how to join.  Lastly, the category for past events/other annual events meets the users' needs by showcasing what SOUP has done in the past through photos and text, and it highlights annual events that will be happening again so users can browse events that they might like to take part in in the future.


### Final Content Organization (Milestone 2)
> Which iteration of card sorting will you use for your website?

Iteration 1

> Explain how the final organization of content is appropriate for your site's audiences.

TODO: why does this organization make sense for your audience (not you)?


### Navigation (Milestone 2)
> Please list the pages you will include in your website's navigation.

- "Home"
- "Past Events"
- "Upcoming Events"
- "Join Us"

> Explain why the names of these pages make sense for your site's audience.

Home Page: The home page serves as the central hub for the website, providing a welcoming introduction to SOUP for both existing members and potential new members. It includes essential information such as the organization's mission, a welcome blurb, and possibly a brief overview of SOUP's activities. This aligns with the audience's need to quickly understand what SOUP is about and how it can benefit them.

Past Events Page: This page is crucial for both existing members and potential members to gain insights into the types of activities SOUP has organized in the past. It allows users to see the variety of outdoor events and adventures the organization has offered, helping them gauge whether SOUP aligns with their interests and outdoor preferences.

Upcoming Events Page: For the audience, especially existing members and those interested in joining SOUP, knowing about upcoming events is vital. This page provides essential logistical information about upcoming outdoor activities, allowing users to plan their participation in advance. It meets the audience's goal of gaining knowledge about upcoming SOUP events and related logistical information.

Join Us Page: This page directly addresses the goal of potential new members to investigate SOUP as a potential outlet for outdoor fun. It provides information on how to join the organization, including membership requirements, registration procedures, and possibly links to join group chats or mailing lists for further engagement. It serves as a call-to-action for interested individuals to become part of the SOUP community.


## Visual Theme (Milestone 2)
> Discuss several (more than two) ideas about styling your site's theme. Explain why the theme ideas are appropriate for your target audiences. Note the theme you selected for your site and why it's appropriate for the audience and their goals.
>
Theme idea 1: classic woodsy nature theme

Color: (greens, greys, and whites with accents of orange)
Green, grey, and white colors can evoke the feeling of being in a lush forest or an orchard. Green represents nature and growth, while grey and white can provide a clean backdrop reminiscent of clouds and sky. Accents of orange can be used to incorporate  warmth and  vibrant energy into the design.

Imagery: Images of trees, foliage, and rustic wooden elements can create a visual connection with nature. Pictures of people enjoying outdoor activities like live music performances amidst trees, or friends having picnics can further enhance the woodsy atmosphere and appeal to the target audience.

Shape: Incorporating organic shapes inspired by nature, such as curved lines, leaf motifs and rounded edges can soften the design and make it feel more natural and inviting.

Typography: Choosing typography with a handcrafted or rustic feel can complement the woodsy theme. Serif fonts with slightly rough edges or handwritten scripts can convey a sense of authenticity and craftsmanship, aligning with the artisanal aspect of the festival. Additionally, ensuring readability is crucial, so selecting fonts that are legible across different devices and screen sizes is essential.


Theme idea 2: energetic, playful outdoorsy theme

Font and Typography:
playful and easy-to-read font that reflects the adventurous spirit of the outdoors. rounded or whimsical fonts that convey a sense of friendliness and energy. varied typography styles for headings, subheadings, and body text to create hierarchy and visual interest.

Colors:
shades of green, blue, yellow, and orange to represent the sky, trees, sunshine, and flowers. Complement these colors with softer pastels for a refreshing look. using contrasting colors to make important elements stand out, while keeping the overall color scheme harmonious and inviting.

Imagery:
Use high-quality photos of people hiking, camping, biking, or enjoying nature.animated or interactive elements like sliders or galleries to showcase different outdoor experiences.

Shapes:
rounded edges, circles, and flowing lines to soften the overall look and create a friendly


Theme idea 3: Community

This visual theme for the website would revolve around the concept of community, incorporating various elements such as colors, imagery, shapes, and typography to evoke a sense of unity, togetherness, and inclusivity. The theme would feature different colors within the same palette to represent diversity within the community while maintaining harmony and cohesion.

Colors: The color palette would consist of warm and inviting hues, such as shades of blue, green, and yellow. These colors symbolize trust, growth, and optimism, fostering a welcoming atmosphere for visitors. Additionally, the use of different colors within the same palette reflects the diverse backgrounds and perspectives within the community.

Imagery: The imagery would predominantly feature visuals of hands holding, embracing, or working together, emphasizing the collaborative spirit and mutual support within the community. Images with groups of people engaged in activities like volunteering, learning, or celebrating would further reinforce the theme of unity and shared purpose.

Shape: The shapes used in the design elements would be organic and fluid, representing the interconnectedness and fluidity of relationships within the community. Circles, curves, and overlapping shapes would be prominent, suggesting inclusivity, continuity, and the idea of coming together as one.

Typography: The typography would be clean, modern, and easily readable, with sans-serif fonts preferred for their simplicity and accessibility. Headings and titles may be bold and capitalized to command attention, while body text would be legible and spacious, ensuring ease of comprehension for all users.


We selected theme 2 as our final theme. We feel this playful, outdoorsy theme effectively captures the SOUP organization's mission of finding fun outdoors! Colors will include bright orange and yellow (from the logo), offset by accents of sky blue to covey a sense of energy through the site. We will likewise incorporate a mix of fonts to make the site dynamic and inviting; specifically, we plan to use a rounded sans-serif or monospace font for the majority of text content and a more unique monospace font for titles and important text. Beyond the images from SOUP events already incorporated into the design, we will include the site's logo, featuring a sundial and a camp fire, to further the outdoorsy feel of the site. We will utilize mostly subtle soft edges throughout the site to convey a casual feel to the site; for example, images will have soft edges. Overall, this theme is appropriate for our site in that it gives the site a sense of energy and playfullness, conveying to users the fun they could have as a member of SOUP, as well as conveying SOUP's emphasis on exploring the outdoors.


## Design (Milestone 2)

Document your site's layout.

## Interactivity Brainstorm (Milestone 2)
> Using the audience goals you identified, brainstorm possible options for interactivity to enhance the functionality of the site while also assisting the audience with their goals.
> Briefly explain idea each idea and provide a brief rationale for how the interactivity enhances the site's functionality for the audience.
> Note: You may find it easier to sketch for brainstorming. That's fine too. Do whatever you need to do to explore your ideas.

- Idea 1: Hamburger menu for header
  - A hamburger menu could appear in the top right corner of the header for narrower screens to enhance the functionality of the header. Considering the header will include the organization's name, logo, and links to all pages of the site, a hamburger menu could free up space in the logo for narrower screens, only displaying the navigation menu when clicked.
- Idea 2: Image carousel
  - We intend to include lots of images on the site to help audiences get a sense of what goes on at SOUP events! Therefore, we think an image carousel could be a good way to include several photos without visually overwhelming audiences. The carousel would transitiion to the left or right to reveal different photos upon the click of the left or right arrow.
- Idea 3: Drop-down
  - We could include a drop-down section to complement each description on our "Upcoming Events" page. The drop down could be triggered by the click of a button, perhaps styled as a "+"; once pressed, it could reveal a section containing logisitcal information about the event (time, location, etc.). This interactivity could help users meet goals by allowing informational as well as logisitcal information to be included about upcoming events while ensuring the digestability of pages. This interactivity could have the information availaible to members and indivudals who want to join SOUP, but hidden for people casually exploring the site to learn about SOUP.


### Layout Exploration (Milestone 2)
> Iterate on your site's design through sketching.
> Sketch both the narrow and wide versions of the site.
> Here you are just exploring your layout ideas. You don't need to sketch every page.
> Include some of your interactivity ideas in your sketches.
> Provide an explanation for each sketch explaining the idea and the design patterns you are leveraging.

![Explorative sketch of desktop version of home page](home-sketch-wide.png)
  This sketch explores a design for the wide version of the site's "Home" page. My intention for this sketch was to create a simple, yet dynamic layout with a mixture of block sections and floating text (block sections for text content and floating text for section titles). I structured all images for this page to be featured in a single carousel that stretches across the page beneath the site's introduction, as images on this home page do not specifically accompany any text content on the page. I employed common design patterns including a header with a logo in the top left corner, the title to the right of that, and a horizontal menu bar aligned to the right. I also styled main links as buttons. I, lastly, created a simple yet informational footer to sandwich the main section of the page.


![Explorative sketch of mobile version of home page](home-sketch-narrow.png)
  This sketch explores a design for the mobile version of the site's "Home" page. For this narrow version, I alterned the structure of the page so information is more vertically stacked. While maintaining the same general vibe and layout, this alteration (adding responsiveness) will make the site more easily readable on a mobile screen. The header is styled similarly except this version features a hamburger button to replace the horizontal menu bar, which does not fit on a narrow screen. The hamburger will toggle to reveal a dropdown navigation menu. The footer and button-styled main links from the previous design remain the same.


![Explorative sketch of desktop version of past events page](past-events-exploration-wide.jpeg)
  This sketch explores the desktop version of the "past events" page. After the header there is a past events heading (h2) to tell what the page entails. The page features a side by side design of the past events and their description. One side of the page will have an images of the event and a figcaption below each to give a brief idea of what the image is about and the other side of the page will have descriptions of each corresponding event, explaining in one paragraph about what happened in the event and how it went. Below the events, there will be a poems section which will have two poems written by the members in a side by side design also to make use of the wide screen size.




![Explorative sketch of mobile version of past events page](past-events-exploration-narrow.jpeg)
  This sketch explores the mobile version of the past events page. The vibe is exactly the same as the wide screen layout but in this, the content is vertically stacked. Instead of the side by side layout of an image of the event on one side and it's description on the other, this layout will instead have an image of the event and the description of the image in a paragraph right below it. The poems will also be stacked vertically, one right below the other so as to make it fit in the narrow screen size.

![Explorative sketch of mobile version of upcoming  events page](wide-exploration-upcoming.PNG)
![Explorative sketch of mobile version of upcoming  events page](3rd-exploration-upcoming.PNG)


### Final Design (Milestone 2)
> Include the final sketches for each of your pages.
> **Include your final interactivity in your sketches.** Include annotations to explain what happens when the user takes an action with your interactivity.
> The sketches must include enough detail that another 1300 student could implement them.
> Please provide an explanation for each sketch.

**Narrow Design:**

![Final sketch of narrow version of "Home" page](final-home-narrow.png)
  My intention for this final mobile layout sketch of the "Home" page is to create a clean, dynamic layout with a mix of block and floating content that are stacked vertically to fit a narrow screen. I utilized various common design patterns including a header with a logo in the top left, the title of the organization to the right of the logo, and a hamburger button aligned to the far right. Upon clicking the hamburger button, a drown-down navigation menu will appear with a vertical list of buttons linking to all pages of the site. I implemented the hamburger button for this narrow layout so that the header wouldn't become too busy. My sketch of the page creates an introduction to SOUP with SOUPs titled written out at the top and a introduction blurb below it. I implemented an image carousel below this so that I could include various images on the page that help introduce the organization to audiences; a carousel was helpful in achieving this while keeping the look of page clean. I designed the carousel as a block that reaches the edge of the browser, with the image centered within this block. Lastly, I implemented a final common design pattern by sketching a simple footer at the botton of the page. All text within the main part of the page are centered, also, as I think this is most visually appealing and fitting for the layout. I plan to use both horizontal and vertical flexboxes in designing this layout, as annotated in the sketch.

![Final sketch of narrow version of "Past Events" page](final-past-events-narrow.jpeg)
  For the mobile version of the "Past Events" page, I aim to replicate the same engaging and dynamic layout while adapting it to fit a narrow screen. This design will prioritize vertical stacking of content to optimize readability and user experience on mobile devices. The header will include the organization's title and logo, with a hamburger button positioned at the far right to reveal a dropdown navigation menu when tapped.

  The page will start with a clear "Past Events" heading (h2) followed by vertically stacked sections for each event. Each event will feature an image at the top, followed immediately by a descriptive paragraph underneath, providing details about the event and its highlights. This format allows for a seamless flow of information without the need for side-by-side elements, ensuring a cohesive and streamlined presentation.

  Below the events section, the poems will be arranged in a vertical stack, one after another, making efficient use of the limited screen space. This approach maintains clarity and readability, ensuring that each piece of content is given its due prominence within the mobile layout.

  Overall, this mobile layout will mirror the aesthetic and vibe of the wide-screen version while employing vertical stacking and simplified design patterns to accommodate the narrower display. The use of centered text and strategic placement of content blocks will contribute to a visually appealing and user-friendly presentation on mobile devices, enhancing the accessibility and engagement of the "Past Events" page for all users.





![Final sketch of narrow version of "Upcoming Events" page](final-zero.jpg)







**Wide Design:**

![Final sketch of wide version of "Home" page](final-home-wide.png)
  My intention for this final desktop layout sketch of the "Home" page is to, again, create a clean, dynamic layout with a mix of block and floating content that are stacked both vertically and horizontally to take advantage of the visual width of the browser. I implement the same header as described above to create consistency across pages. In this wide version, however, I take advatange of the width of the screen and omit the hamburger button, instead implementing a horizontal navigation bar with button links to pages. Below the header, my sketch of the page creates an introduction to SOUP with SOUPs titled written out and a introduction blurb below it. Below this, I implement the same image carousel, as explained in the narrow sketch description. Next, I create a horizontal flexblox that includes text about the history of SOUP to the left and quotes from members to the right. Lastly, I implement a final common design pattern by sketching a simple footer at the botton of the page. All text within the main part of the page are centered, also, as I think this is most visually appealing and fitting for the layout. I plan to use horizontal flexboxes in bringing this layout to life, as annotated in the sketch.

![Final sketch of wide version of "Past Events" page](final-past-events-wide.jpeg)

  Beneath the events section, there will be a dedicated area for poetry, presented in a side-by-side format to maximize the use of wide screens. Members' poems will be showcased with thoughtful design elements to complement the overall aesthetic of the page.

  This layout aims to balance imagery and text effectively, providing an immersive experience for visitors. The goal is to create a cohesive and visually appealing presentation that reflects the spirit and history of the events hosted by SOUP. Each element will be carefully arranged to optimize space and readability, enhancing the overall user experience of the "Past Events" page.



### Design Rationale (Milestone 2)
> Explain why your design is appropriate for your audience.
> Specifically, why does your content organization, navigation, and site design/layout meet the goals of your users?
> How did you employ **design patterns** to improve the familiarity of the site for your audience?

  Our website design is carefully crafted to meet the needs of outdoor enthusiasts seeking a vibrant community like SOUP. The navigation menu includes intuitive pages titled "Home," "Past Events," "Upcoming Events," and "Join Us," providing essential information and facilitating user goals. The "Home" page introduces SOUP's mission and activities, engaging both existing and potential members. "Past Events" and "Upcoming Events" offer transparency and details on previous and upcoming adventures, helping users plan their participation. The "Join Us" page simplifies membership steps for new members. In terms of design, we have employed familiar patterns such as the hamburger menu for mobile navigation, ensuring ease of access to all pages without cluttering the header. Our use of a horizontal navigation bar on the desktop version enhances visibility and intuitiveness, guiding users seamlessly through the site. Furthermore, our layout design incorporates elements like image carousels and blocks of content arranged strategically to maintain engagement and showcase the adventurous spirit of SOUP. The use of centered text and a mix of fonts adds a dynamic and inviting touch, catering to the visual preferences of our audience. Our design prioritizes user experience, aiming to create an inviting digital space that reflects SOUP's energy and encourages engagement.


## Interactivity Rationale (Milestone 2)
> Describe the purpose of your proposed interactivity.
> Provide a brief rationale explaining how your proposed interactivity addresses the goals of your site's audience and enhances their user experience.

Our proposed interactivity, including a hamburger button in the header, image carousel, and several drop-down blocks, helps users meet their goals by enhancing the usability of our site by relying on common and familiar web design patterns.

Our image carousel ensures that users can browse through lots of photos without the images taking up a large amount of room on the site.  With the image carousel, what would be a long page cluttered with photos becomes a streamlined page that allows users to navigate the site quickly and easily to find what they're looking for.  If they want to spend time browsing images, then they can use the carousel and if not, then the images are out of the user's way.

The hamburger menu on the narrow version of the site is a common design pattern in responsive web design.  It allows the nav menu to not take up an inordinate amount of space in the narrow version of a site.  This is helpful because it reduces "clutter" on the site and makes it easier to use.

The drop-down features we're using allow users to read the title of an upcoming event and then click on a button to reveal more information about the event, such as when it's taking place.  This allows users to browse through events by their titles and then choose whether or not they want to learn more about it.  Many users will likely be comeing to the site to learn more about a specific upcoming event, so this interactivity feature allows them to quickly find the event of interest without having to do a lot of scrolling and parsing of information.
