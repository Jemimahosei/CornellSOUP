# Group Project: Design Journey

**For each milestone, complete only the sections that are labeled with that milestone.** Refine all sections before the final submission.

You are graded on your design process. If you later need to update your plan, **do not delete the original plan, leave it in place and append your new plan _below_ the original.** Then explain why you are changing your plan. Any time you update your plan, you're documenting your design process!

**Replace ALL _TODOs_ with your work.** (There should be no TODOs in the final submission.)

Be clear and concise in your writing. Bullets points are encouraged.

Place all design journey images inside the "design-plan" folder and then link them in Markdown so that they are visible in Markdown Preview.

**Everything, including images, must be visible in _Markdown: Open Preview_.** If it's not visible in the Markdown preview, then we can't grade it. We also can't give you partial credit either. **Please make sure your design journey should is easy to read for the grader;** in Markdown preview the question _and_ answer should have a blank line between them.


## Client (Milestone 1)

### Client Description (Milestone 1)
> Tell us about your client. Who is your client?
> Explain why your client meets the client rules in the project requirements.

Our client is Cornell SOUP (students for outdoor unsupervised playtime), which is an unofficial campus club.  They are unofficial because they put on events that Cornell might not fully approve of in terms of safety (e.g. 24 hour capture the flag in the woods), though they do take safety very seriously and do their best to ensure the health of all SOUP activity participants.  For example, they have dedicated medics for each event and they ensure a means of communication with the outside world, even if the event takes place in a remote area.

SOUP was founded in 2021 during the pandemic.  It is currently being run by its second generation of leaders.  It is an organization dedicated to helping students connect with each other through "crazy" outdoor adventures.  They want to have a website that showcases their mission, the past events that they're put on, and their upcoming events.

SOUP leaders don't want a big site.  They just want something slightly more official and accessible than Intsagram and GroupMe to use to connect with their members and prospective participants.  They don't require a site reliant on advanced web design practices, so we are confident that we will be able to build a website that will be satisfactory.

### Client Questionnaire (Milestone 1)
> Develop a client questionnaire to learn more about your client and their goals.
> You may use the questionnaire below, you may modify the questionnaire below, or you may create your own.

1. Describe your organization and its purpose.


2. What makes your organization and its services special or unique?


3. Why are you looking for a new website or updating your existing site?


4. Who do you want to visit your site? Who do you believe is your website's intended audience?


5. What are your goals for this site?


6. Is there a "feel" that you want for your site? Are there colors or imagery that you have in mind?


7. (Modified due to the answer to question 4): What past experiences have led you to believe that a website would be a good addition to your organization?

8. Do you have any images and/or written content already that you'd like us to incorporate?


### First Client Meeting Minutes/Notes (Milestone 1)
> Include your notes/minutes from your first meeting with your client.

1. Please describe your organization and its purpose/mission.

- started SOUP because outing club, cornell outdoor education, etc. were lacking in more extreme adventures because they're officially linked to Cornell and liability is a limiting factor
- wanted to make a new organization for Cornell students that wasn't beholden to the same rules as other, more official organizations
- the goal of SOUP (Students for Outdoor Unsupervized Playtime) is to allow students who are a little bit crazy to do crazy things with other students who are a little bit crazy
- past events include 24-hour capture the flag and a campus-wide game of manhunt, among other things
- mission is to help connect students who want to participate in the crazier side of outdoor activities
- concerned about liability/not seeming to be too connected to Cornell
- started in 2020 because original founders wanted to play a 24-hour game of capture the flag, then SOUP was founded after that because it turned out to be so fun and people seemed to want more of that type of thing


2. What makes your organization and its services special or unique?

- 450+ members now
- all recruitment has been word of mouth
- not affiliated with Cornell officially, so not liable and constrained like other orgs are
- the entire organization has gained its following through word of mouth and no official recruitment events or outreach
- most events are held annually (for the last 4 years)
- values of the organization: playfulness, freedom, connection

3. Why are you looking for a new website or updating your existing site?

- currently there is no website
- lots of people have asked if there is a website
- currently, there's only an Instagram account (@cornell__soup)
- a website would be good for people who don't have instagram

4. Who do you want to visit your site? Who do you believe is your website's intended audience?

- want people who are interested in participating in SOUP events to visit the site
- also people who have participated in the past and might want to see photos of the past events
- intended audience: people who are interested in participating in a SOUP event and/or have already participated int one

5. What are your goals for this site?

- showcase previous events through photos and descriptions
- advertise upcoming events
- give some context and history around the existence of SOUP
- let newcommers learn about SOUP and what it has to offer
- help people pitch their own events for SOUP to put on

6. Is there a "feel" that you want for your site? Are there colors or imagery that you have in mind?

- logo is shades of orange and red, with notes of white and black
- definitely include the logo in the site
- lots of room for photos (maybe an image carousel)
- include the colors in the logo
- shouldn't be too crowded, want it to feel a bit loose and airy and playful
- should embody the values of the organization: playfulness, freedom, connection

7. (Modified due to the answer to question 4): What past experiences have led you to believe that a website would be a good addition to your organization?

- people have often asked before if SOUP has a website
- it would help people who don't have Instagram or GroupMe find out information about upcoming events
- central hub for all SOUP-related information
- would allow for more content than Instagram does (more text and photos)
- some people have heard about SOUP but then couldn't find anything online about it because there is no website and it's not an official Cornell club, so it's not listed on any Cornell site.  A website could help people who have just about it through word of mouth find it online when they search for it, if they weren't added to the GroupMe when they heard about it.

8. Do you have any images and/or written content already that you'd like us to incorporate?

Yes, they will share it with us later.

### Client Website (Milestone 1)
> Tell us about the website that your client wants.
> Tell us the purpose of the website and what it is all about.
> Note: **If you are redesigning an existing website, give us the current URL and some screenshots of the current site.** (FireFox makes it easy to take a full screenshot of a page from the context menu (right click).)
> If you are redesigning an existing site, tell us how you plan to update the site significantly that meets the project's requirements.

The leaders of SOUP want a website that showcases their past successful events.  They also want to provide information about upcoming events.  Also, they want to have a lot of photos on the website.  They want it to look somewhat professional without being too polished and clean.  They want it to have an outdoorsy, whimsical vibe.  It will replace the GroupMe QR code on all future signs/flyers, so people will be directed to the site.  People who scan these flyers are interested in the specific event that it's advertising, but they might not already know about SOUP, so imagine the website as a landing page for people who might not know what SOUP is but are interested in potentially participating.  Lastly, they want to have information on how to join SOUP leadership and/or pitch ideas for events.  There is no official leadership, it's really just whoever want to put on an event is able to, so they want to have a place on the website where you can pitch events.

### Client Goals (Milestone 1)
> Identify your client's goals for the website.
> What kind of website do they want? What are their goals for the site?
> There is no required number of goals. You need as many goals as necessary to reflect your client's desires.

- Goal #1: Showcase their previous events through images and text.
- Goal #2: Advertise upcoming events and provide details about them.
- Goal #3: Provide information about what SOUP is, its mission, and its backstory.
- Goal #4: Guide people on how to pitch their own SOUP events.

### Client Website Scope (Milestone 1)
> We want your project to be successful! It needs to be ambitious, but not too large.
> A good rule-of-thumb is that you should have about 1 content-full page for each team member.
> Explain why the website you will create for your client isn't too small and isn't too big.
> Explain why you think it's the right size for this project.

There are four main goals for the site, which is perfect because there are four of us in the group.  Besides having lots of photos, SOUP leadership doesn't want the site to be too big or cumbersome, and they said that ideally it would be 5 pags maximum.  They also don't want anything too fancy, which is good for us because we will certainly learn enough in this class to address their needs.  The people in charge of SOUP are other students, so it's easy to stay in touch with them and having meetings on campus.

## Plan/Schedule (Milestone 1)
> Make a plan of when you will complete all parts of this assignment.
> This plan is for your team. There is no required format. Format it so that it works for you!
> Your plan should include when you will interview users and analyze their goals.
> Your plan should also include how and when you will assemble/create the sit's content.
