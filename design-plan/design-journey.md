# Group Project: Design Journey

**For each milestone, complete only the sections that are labeled with that milestone.** Refine all sections before the final submission.

You are graded on your design process. If you later need to update your plan, **do not delete the original plan, leave it in place and append your new plan _below_ the original.** Then explain why you are changing your plan. Any time you update your plan, you're documenting your design process!

**Replace ALL _TODOs_ with your work.** (There should be no TODOs in the final submission.)

Be clear and concise in your writing. Bullets points are encouraged.

Place all design journey images inside the "design-plan" folder and then link them in Markdown so that they are visible in Markdown Preview.

**Everything, including images, must be visible in _Markdown: Open Preview_.** If it's not visible in the Markdown preview, then we can't grade it. We also can't give you partial credit either. **Please make sure your design journey should is easy to read for the grader;** in Markdown preview the question _and_ answer should have a blank line between them.


## Client (Milestone 1)

### Client Description (Milestone 1)
> Tell us about your client. Who is your client?
> Explain why your client meets the client rules in the project requirements.

Our client is Cornell SOUP (students for outdoor unsupervised playtime), which is an unofficial campus club.  They are unofficial because they put on events that Cornell might not fully approve of in terms of safety (e.g. 24 hour capture the flag in the woods), though they do take safety very seriously and do their best to ensure the health of all SOUP activity participants.  For example, they have dedicated medics for each event and they ensure a means of communication with the outside world, even if the event takes place in a remote area.

SOUP was founded in 2021 during the pandemic.  It is currently being run by its second generation of leaders.  It is an organization dedicated to helping students connect with each other through "crazy" outdoor adventures.  They want to have a website that showcases their mission, the past events that they're put on, and their upcoming events.

SOUP leaders don't want a big site.  They just want something slightly more official and accessible than Intsagram and GroupMe to use to connect with their members and prospective participants.  They don't require a site reliant on advanced web design practices, so we are confident that we will be able to build a website that will be satisfactory.

### Client Questionnaire (Milestone 1)
> Develop a client questionnaire to learn more about your client and their goals.
> You may use the questionnaire below, you may modify the questionnaire below, or you may create your own.

1. Describe your organization and its purpose.


2. What makes your organization and its services special or unique?


3. Why are you looking for a new website or updating your existing site?


4. Who do you want to visit your site? Who do you believe is your website's intended audience?


5. What are your goals for this site?


6. Is there a "feel" that you want for your site? Are there colors or imagery that you have in mind?


7. (Modified due to the answer to question 4): What past experiences have led you to believe that a website would be a good addition to your organization?

8. Do you have any images and/or written content already that you'd like us to incorporate?


### First Client Meeting Minutes/Notes (Milestone 1)
> Include your notes/minutes from your first meeting with your client.

1. Please describe your organization and its purpose/mission.

- started SOUP because outing club, cornell outdoor education, etc. were lacking in more extreme adventures because they're officially linked to Cornell and liability is a limiting factor
- wanted to make a new organization for Cornell students that wasn't beholden to the same rules as other, more official organizations
- the goal of SOUP (Students for Outdoor Unsupervized Playtime) is to allow students who are a little bit crazy to do crazy things with other students who are a little bit crazy
- past events include 24-hour capture the flag and a campus-wide game of manhunt, among other things
- mission is to help connect students who want to participate in the crazier side of outdoor activities
- concerned about liability/not seeming to be too connected to Cornell
- started in 2020 because original founders wanted to play a 24-hour game of capture the flag, then SOUP was founded after that because it turned out to be so fun and people seemed to want more of that type of thing


2. What makes your organization and its services special or unique?

- 450+ members now
- all recruitment has been word of mouth
- not affiliated with Cornell officially, so not liable and constrained like other orgs are
- the entire organization has gained its following through word of mouth and no official recruitment events or outreach
- most events are held annually (for the last 4 years)
- values of the organization: playfulness, freedom, connection

1. Why are you looking for a new website or updating your existing site?

- currently there is no website
- lots of people have asked if there is a website
- currently, there's only an Instagram account (@cornell__soup)
- a website would be good for people who don't have instagram

4. Who do you want to visit your site? Who do you believe is your website's intended audience?

- want people who are interested in participating in SOUP events to visit the site
- also people who have participated in the past and might want to see photos of the past events
- intended audience: people who are interested in participating in a SOUP event and/or have already participated int one

5. What are your goals for this site?

- showcase previous events through photos and descriptions
- advertise upcoming events
- give some context and history around the existence of SOUP
- let newcommers learn about SOUP and what it has to offer
- help people pitch their own events for SOUP to put on

6. Is there a "feel" that you want for your site? Are there colors or imagery that you have in mind?

- logo is shades of orange and red, with notes of white and black
- definitely include the logo in the site
- lots of room for photos (maybe an image carousel)
- include the colors in the logo
- shouldn't be too crowded, want it to feel a bit loose and airy and playful
- should embody the values of the organization: playfulness, freedom, connection

7. (Modified due to the answer to question 4): What past experiences have led you to believe that a website would be a good addition to your organization?

- people have often asked before if SOUP has a website
- it would help people who don't have Instagram or GroupMe find out information about upcoming events
- central hub for all SOUP-related information
- would allow for more content than Instagram does (more text and photos)
- some people have heard about SOUP but then couldn't find anything online about it because there is no website and it's not an official Cornell club, so it's not listed on any Cornell site.  A website could help people who have just about it through word of mouth find it online when they search for it, if they weren't added to the GroupMe when they heard about it.

8. Do you have any images and/or written content already that you'd like us to incorporate?

Yes, they will share it with us later.

### Client Website (Milestone 1)
> Tell us about the website that your client wants.
> Tell us the purpose of the website and what it is all about.
> Note: **If you are redesigning an existing website, give us the current URL and some screenshots of the current site.** (FireFox makes it easy to take a full screenshot of a page from the context menu (right click).)
> If you are redesigning an existing site, tell us how you plan to update the site significantly that meets the project's requirements.

The leaders of SOUP want a website that showcases their past successful events.  They also want to provide information about upcoming events.  Also, they want to have a lot of photos on the website.  They want it to look somewhat professional without being too polished and clean.  They want it to have an outdoorsy, whimsical vibe.  It will replace the GroupMe QR code on all future signs/flyers, so people will be directed to the site.  People who scan these flyers are interested in the specific event that it's advertising, but they might not already know about SOUP, so imagine the website as a landing page for people who might not know what SOUP is but are interested in potentially participating.  Lastly, they want to have information on how to join SOUP leadership and/or pitch ideas for events.  There is no official leadership, it's really just whoever want to put on an event is able to, so they want to have a place on the website where you can pitch events.

### Client Goals (Milestone 1)
> Identify your client's goals for the website.
> What kind of website do they want? What are their goals for the site?
> There is no required number of goals. You need as many goals as necessary to reflect your client's desires.

- Goal #1: Showcase their previous events through images and text.
- Goal #2: Advertise upcoming events and provide details about them.
- Goal #3: Provide information about what SOUP is, its mission, and its backstory.
- Goal #4: Guide people on how to pitch their own SOUP events.

### Client Website Scope (Milestone 1)
> We want your project to be successful! It needs to be ambitious, but not too large.
> A good rule-of-thumb is that you should have about 1 content-full page for each team member.
> Explain why the website you will create for your client isn't too small and isn't too big.
> Explain why you think it's the right size for this project.

There are four main goals for the site, which is perfect because there are four of us in the group.  Besides having lots of photos, SOUP leadership doesn't want the site to be too big or cumbersome, and they said that ideally it would be 5 pags maximum.  They also don't want anything too fancy, which is good for us because we will certainly learn enough in this class to address their needs.  The people in charge of SOUP are other students, so it's easy to stay in touch with them and having meetings on campus.

## Plan/Schedule (Milestone 1)
> Make a plan of when you will complete all parts of this assignment.
> This plan is for your team. There is no required format. Format it so that it works for you!
> Your plan should include when you will interview users and analyze their goals.
> Your plan should also include how and when you will assemble/create the sit's content.
> **Tip:** Your team should plan to work ahead. This project really isn't feasible to complete the night before a deadline.

## Website Design Exploration (Milestone 2)

Identify three websites (preferably static websites) that exist today on the web to draw inspiration from. Please select websites that are similar to the website you wish to create.

Include two screenshots of the home page for each site: narrow and wide.

**We'll refer to these are your "example websites."**

### Example Website 1 Review (Milestone 2)
> Review the website you identified above. (1 paragraph)
> In your review, include a discussion common design patterns and interactivity in the site.

Here is what the website does effectively regarding layout, interactivity, and responsiveness:

- When the site is narrow the nav menu becomes a hamburger menu and when the site is wide the nav menu is easy to find at the top of the page below the header.  Both of these are traditional, familiar design patterns.
- The image carousel at the top of the page adds a nice level of interactivity that allows users to scroll through the images in a familiar way.  The carousel is present in the narrow version of the site as well, but without the menu and extra text overlapping with it.
- The 3-column grid layout of links and photos in the wide layout becomes a 2-column grid in the medium layout, and then becomes a single column of content in the mobile site.  This is helpful because it allows the content to still take prominence in the narrow layout, even though the window width is smaller.
- The site has links to other pages in multiple places instead of just in the nav bar.  This is helpful because it allows users to see an image or read a short description of something and then choose to read more, only if they choose to click on it.  This would likely not be useful on the site we're building for SOUP because it seems more suitable for a large site with lots and lots of pages.

Here is what the site does poorly:

- In the narrow version, it is confusing to have two hamburger menus at the top of the screen.  One is present in both versions of the site and the other only appears in the narrow version.
- The faded overlay is not ideal for the hero images at the top of the page because it infringes too much on the images and undercuts their prominence and importance by blocking them out a bit.
- In the narrow version of the site, some of the images and videos are too wide and go off of the screen instead of adjusting their width/layout to fit on the screen.  This is mainly an issue with videos.
- Some of the images don't have alt text, and some have poorly written alt text.


### Example Website 2 Review (Milestone 2)
> Review the website you identified above. (1 paragraph)
> In your review, include a discussion common design patterns and interactivity in the site.

Here is what the website does effectively regarding layout, interactivity, and responsiveness:

- They have an interactive calendar feature where you can toggle between the weekly and monthly calendars.  This exists in both the narrow and wide versions of the site and it is very helpful to be able to se both versions of the calendar without going to different pages or having to scroll.
- The photos on their home page are in a single row for the wide layout and transition to two rows for the narrow layout.  This follows common design patterns and allows users to view the photos in the narrow layout without them becoming too small.
- Some of the photos bring users to the club's Instagram page when clicked on.  This could be useful for SOUP because they have a lot of photos that they would like on their site, many of which are already posted on Instagram.  Additionally, Instagram (in addition to GroupMe) has been the only form of social media/online presence that SOUP has had so far, so it might be helpful to users to provide the link to SOUP's Instagram on the website.
- The navigation menu collapses into a hamburger menu when the site is narrow.  This is a common design pattern and it is implemented well on this website.
- The video as well as photos resize appropriately according to the screen width.

Here is what the site does poorly:

- The header text is helpful and the header image is a powerful image, but the way that they are layered isn't visually appealing.  It would be better if the text was above or below the image so it didn't block out the image.  The way it is on the site detracts from both the header text and the header image.
- You can't directly click on the nav menu links to navigate to a new page.  Instead, a drop down menu appears for each link.  This goes against best web design practices.  It would be better to have a new "home page" for each category listed in the nav bar, each with its own nav bar for various pages under that category.  Users expect a nav bar to link to different pages, so it's annoying to click on a link in the nav bar and not be taken to a new page.
- The video quality isn't very good at all, though this might not be something that they have any control over if it's hosted on YouTube or some other service.
- At intermediate screen widths (between narrow and wide), the nav menu wraps around so one menu item is below the rest.  This looks sloppy and out of place, and it would be better if it seamlessly transitioned from the full-width nav menu to the hamburger menu instead of having a strange, visually unappealing mid-size layout.
- The footer is relatively large in the narrow version of the website.  The footer height makes sense in the wide version of the site, but it takes up a lot of space and the text elements contained within it have a disproportionate amount of padding/margin in the narrow version, making the footer bigger than it needs to be ideally folloing bst web design practices.

### Example Website 3 Review (Milestone 2)
> Review the website you identified above. (1 paragraph)
> In your review, include a discussion common design patterns and interactivity in the site.

Here is what the website does effectively regarding layout, interactivity, and responsiveness:

- It's helpful that the image carousel automatically changes pictures without the user having to manually select a new picture, even though they can still do that if they wish.  This allows users to passively see multiple images or navigate to one in particular, so it's a mix of passive and active interactivity.
- The site has is a very consistent theme throughout including topographical maps as a background for each image, the signature NOLS font being used for all header text, and the NOLS shade of orange making multiple appearances in various places.
- The Featured Expeditions section of the home page changes from a grid in the wide version of the site into a carousel in the narrow version of the site.  This is a common design pattern, so users are familiar with it and that helps with ease of use.  It's also an effective way to change the layout of the content so as to not crowd the page with content or make it too excessively prominent.
- In the narrow version of the site, there is just the NOLS logo along with a hamburger menu at the top of the page whereas in the wide version of the site layout, there is a full horizontal nav bar.  This is a common design pattern and it's very effective at reducing clutter in the narrow version of a website.
- In the narrow version, images are (for the most part) in a single column and they take up the full width of the page, allowing users to see them fully even though the screen is smaller.  In the wide version, images are mostly in two columns side by side.  This is a common web design pattern so users are familiar with it.
