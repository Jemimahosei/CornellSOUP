# Submission Instructions

Stage, commit and push **all** changed files in your Git repository to GitHub. (All commits must reside on the _main_ branch.)

Then, **one** team member should fill-out the [submission form](https://cornell.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6ytbtFEheWFOMR0) to finalize your team's submission.

_Every_ team member is required to check that the correct Git commit/hash was submitted and that the commit is complete and ready to be graded.

**Tip:** Who ever submits the submission form should forward the confirmation email to all team members so that _everyone_ may check the submission.
